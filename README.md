## Description
_In this game, user can play the very famous Go Fish Game. In the game, every player gets 5 cards, the rest of the cards(deck) are put faced down where all players can get them. When its a Player's turn they ask another player for the same color and number as the one they have, if the other player has such card, they give it to the one that asked, and the one that asked puts the pair in front of them and gets to go again. If the other player does not have the card, then they say "Go Fish" and the player that asked takes a card from the deck and the next player goes. If a player has no cards when it is time for him to go, then he just takes a card from the deck and the next player goes. If there are no cards in the deck and the player has no cards, the player does not get to go. The game ends when all the cards are face up in pairs. The winner is the player with the most pairs._

## Setup/Installation
* Open your git bash Terminal to Clone the Project with a (git clone _REPOSITORY_NAME_)
* Ensure you have the .NET6.0 Framework Installed(I used .NET6.0.402 For this Application) on your PC and you must have done the essential steps to at least writing a C# code in the REPL 
* If you're not interested in seeing the Build message, run the command: dotnet run, this builds and runs the application for you but if you are interested in seing the Build message carry out the 2 steps below
* Still in the Git bash Terminal, run the command: dotnet build --- This builds The Project and adds the essential directories(like bin and obj) to execute the application
* After building the application, Now its time to run the command: dotnet run --- And you get to see the web application open up on your default browser, or you can copy the link on bash where the project is being listed, the link looks like this: https://localhost:5001 and paste on your browser.
* You can also run "dotnet watch run" which executes the Application in development mode.
